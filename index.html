                        My career as an Actor and Performer up until this point has taken me all over. I have lived all
                        and worked on
                        over the east coast for the past 8 years, mainly between Philadelphia and NYC. I've toured the
                        country with a national tour
                        and even played Off-Broadway! Even though I'm extremely excited to become a
                        software
                        developer and to change the trajectory my career has taken me, the fine arts will always be a
                        big part
                        of my life and my experiences will inform my perspective as a developer!

                        I've been learning Software Development as a hobby for a couple of years now! It started out
                        pretty simple, but I've dabbled in a verity of basic projects. I'm currently enrolled in the
                        Flatiron School Software Developer Intensive to turn this hobby into the foundation for a new
                        career.

                    <p>Lately I've been dipping my toes in the generative art scene and have played around some. This
                        gif shows random point generated fractals based on The Sierpi≈Ñski triangle. When the lines of
                        symmetry around the axis are a whole number, you can see distinct patterns in the animation. I
                        took the images between 1 and 8 sides and combined them into this gif.

                        During the pandemic I've taken up the woodworking hobby. I find it a great combination of
                        technical skills and artistic fulfillment. I've mostly stuck to simple and small projects:
                        jewelry and dice boxes, letter boxes, clock faces, and cutting/cheese boards. I've also begun to
                        play with the use of epoxy resin and dyes to add a pop of color.
